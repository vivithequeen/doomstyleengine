# doom style engine
very simple software renderer, made in a few days. im glad i was able to figure out how the walls should render without being blocky like a raycaster.
# run!!!
to compile and run :)
```bash
make config=release_x64 && ./bin/Release/doomstyleengine
```

# stuff!!!!
i made this because i wanted to expand on my previous experimentation with software rendering, unfortuanlty it did not get as far as i really wanted to.
